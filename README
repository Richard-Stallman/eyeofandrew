ACC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NAME
    acc - andrew control center

SYNOPSIS
    acc -c user hostfile iterations sleep eoa_path [-r] [-o alf]
    acc [-m alf1 alf2 ...] [-s alf] [-r] [-o alf]

DESCRIPTION

OPTIONS
    -c user hostfile iterations sleep eoa_path
        PSSH into all hosts in the given hostfile as the given user, calling
        eyeOfAndrew (found at eoa_path) for the given number of iterations
        with the given sleep interval. Output will be stored in the file
        specified by the -o flag or in the current directory as out.alf by
        default.

    -m alf1 alf2 ...
        Merge the given ALFs into a sigle ALF. This file will be named as
        specified by the -o flag or "out.alf" in the current directory by
        default.

    -s alf
        Split the given ALF into a separate ALF for each hostname. These files
        will be named by the convention "ALF_host.alf" where "ALF" is the name
        of the input file and "host" is the name of each host.

    -r
        Remove temporary or source files involved in operation after output is
        written.

    -o filename
        Name of the output file for an operation with a single output.

EYEOFANDREW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NAME
    eyeOfAndrew - server-side script for acc

SYNOPSIS
    eyeOfAndrew [iterations] [sleep_interval]

DESCRIPTION
    eyeOfAndrew repeatedly calls the "w" command, storing the result to a file
    that is unique for each hostname. Calls are separated by the specified time
    interval, during which the script sleeps. Once the final call is made, the
    script "cat"s the file, causing pssh to pass it to the local machine, and
    the file on the remote server is removed.

OPTIONS
    First parameter gives the number of times data collection will be
    performed (default is 1).

    Second parameter gives the sleep interval, in seconds, between data
    collections (default is 10).

ALF FILE FORMAT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW
    The alf (Andrew library file) file format is used to store data captured by
    the ACC program. An arbitrary number of captures from an arbitrary number
    of machines can be stored in one file, and all data is stored in a plaintext
    format.

DETAILS
    An ALF file adheres to the following guidelines.

    1 All data captured from any host is stored consecutively within the file
    
    2 Prior to the data captured from the host $HOSTNAME and without any data
      captured from another host between it and its corresponding data is a 
      line reading "$HOSTNAME" (the quotes are not in the ALF)

    3 Prior to the data captured at time $TIME and without any data captured at
      another time between it and its corresponding data is a line reading
      "$TIME" where $TIME is itself of the form "MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS" using a 
      24 hour clock and padding any value with zeros if necessary.

    4 Each data line starts with a space-separated list of the following data
      points in the given order: USER, TTY, FROM, LOGIN@, IDLE, JCPU, PCPU,
      RUNNINGAPPLICATION.

    5 Each data line ends with a (possibly empty) space-separated list of
      arguments provided to the running application. These arguments may be
      truncated or incomplete as w limits the number of characters for this
      column

    6 Each data line contains only one USER, TTY, etc. data point

    Note that there are no limits on the number of spaces separating columns in
    data lines. It is recommended to use spaces as necessary to align columns.
    Note also that it is valid to enter any number of black lines at any point
    within the file.
